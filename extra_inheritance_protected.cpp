#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// By using protected inheritance, the private members of the base class are
// inaccessible in the derived class and in main. Protected and Public members
// of the base class are accessible to the derived class but not in main and
// become protected members of the derived class.
//
// Letâ€™s take an example of protected inheritance:

class Vehicle{

    string Make;
    string Color;
    int Year;

protected:
    string Model;

public:
    Vehicle(){
        Make = "";
        Color = "";
        Year = 0;
        Model = "";
    }

    Vehicle(string mk, string col, int yr, string mdl){
        Make = mk;
        Color = col;
        Year = yr;
        Model = mdl;
    }

    void print_details(){
        cout << "Manufacturer: " << Make << endl;
        cout << "Color: " << Color << endl;
        cout << "Year: " << Year << endl;
    }
};

class Car: protected Vehicle{
    string trunk_size;

public:
    Car(){
        trunk_size = "";
    }

    Car(string mk, string col, int yr, string mdl, string ts)
            :Vehicle(mk, col, yr, mdl){
        trunk_size = ts;
    }

    void car_details(){
        print_details();
        cout << "Trunk size: " << trunk_size << endl;
        cout << "Model: " << Model << endl;  // Model is protected and
        // is accessible in derived class
    }
};
