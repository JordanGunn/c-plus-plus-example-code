// Class members (data and functions) have visibility (just like Java!)
// •'public' members are accessible anywhere
// •'private' members are only accessible from within the class
// •'protected' members are accessible in the class and its subclasses (in C++ we call these derived classes)
//
// •By default, all class members have private access
// •Note:   a struct and a class are the same thing in C++, except when we use the
//          keyword “struct” members get public access by default
