// THE RULES OF PRECEDENCE AND ASSOCIATIVITY

// PRECEDENCE:      Refers to the order in which operators are evaluated
//                  in a compound expression.

// ASSOCIATIVITY:   Refers to the order in which operators are evaluated
//                  in the same precedence level (left to right OR right to left).
